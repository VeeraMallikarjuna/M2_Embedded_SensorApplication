# INTRODUCTION
## Temperature sensor
The main Theme of this Project is to measure the temperature across that particular area and adjust the temperature according to our requirements.
Nowdays Automation is everywhere, all the functions are done by microcontroller it self. Here ATMEGA328 microcontroller is used in our project and this controller is easy to interface.

## Features
1. we can adjust the temperature acccording to our need.
2.  Easy to design.
3.  Low cost as compared to other controllers.

## SWOT Analysis
### strength
1. User Friendly
2. Easy to alter the temperature inside that area.

### Weakness
used in Low temperature areas.

### Opportunities
It can be used for other applications by changing the sensors.

### Threats
Not Suitable for Average or High Temperature areas.

## 4W's & 1H
WHAT -- Temperature Sensor Application
WHEN -- At Low Temperature
WHERE-- Heating Applications
WHY --  To produce Heat 

## High level Requirements
 we should know the knowledge of sensors and its Applications So we can change the temperature according to our need.
 
 ## Low Level Requirements
 No need of any external circuitary.
